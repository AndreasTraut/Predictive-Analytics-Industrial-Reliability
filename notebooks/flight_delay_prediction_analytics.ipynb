        "4.  **Save to Database**: The processed DataFrame is then saved into a SQLite database named `flights2024.db` as a table called `flights2024`. This step ensures that the data is persistently stored and can be easily queried later."

        "4.  **Train/Test Split**: The data is further split into training and testing sets (`X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`) using `train_test_split`. This allows the model to be trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data to assess its generalization performance. `stratify=y` ensures that the proportion of delayed vs. non-delayed flights is maintained in both sets.\n",
        "5.  **Scale Numeric Features**: Numerical features in `X_train` and `X_test` are scaled using `StandardScaler`. This standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, which can help improve the performance and convergence of some machine learning algorithms."
